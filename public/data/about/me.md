## About me

My name is João, I'm from Portugal and I'm a fullstack developer with a focus on frontend development.

After dedicating several years to different projects, I decided I should be decicating my time and energy to companies doing something that really matters to me, instead of just trying to be the next unicorn and having pizza fridays. I realize that the world problems are not solved with more tech, but I would like to help out as I can.

I currently work as a frontend developer at [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) in Berlin. I was a volunteer teacher at [ReDI School of Integration](https://www.redi-school.org/) for a semester for a semester in 2021.

I care deeply about libre software and internet privacy. As such, I'm a full-time Linux and Firefox user. I've also been expanding my knowledge of web accessibility greatly in the last year. I'm fortunate enough that these are two topics of great importance where I work.

Finally, I care a lot about human and animal rights. I've been mostly vegetarian for almost ten years, and vegan for the past 5. I love browsing recipe blogs and subreddits and trying alternative ingredients that make people show the funniest facial expressions when they hear about them. Did you know you can use the water from a can of chickpeas as replacement for eggs in a merengue?
