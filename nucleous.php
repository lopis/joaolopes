This center, or 'Nucleous' as we called it, was a big part of my life in those two years and it was a big deal in defining who I am today. We learned new things every day and dealt with problems that most students never found throughout their academic lifes. We helped out anyone in the campus looking for help with problems software or hardware related and shared our knowledge between members. This was the place where I made my first college friends and where I met those that I kept until today.
