==== Project GitHub Repositories ====

[[https://github.com/lopis/sajas|SAJaS]] is the core of my project. It consists of an API for use in simulation frameworks that enable MAS features present in JADE to be used on them. 

[[https://github.com/lopis/MASSim2Dev|MASSim2Dev]] is an eclipse plugin that converts Repast simulations based on SAJaS into JADE applications as seamlessly as possible. 

I use a third repository to keep track of my [[https://github.com/lopis/sajas-example|test scenarios]].
