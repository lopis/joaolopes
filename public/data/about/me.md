## About me

My name is Jo√£o, I'm from Portugal and I'm a fullstack developer with a focus on frontend development.

After more than 4 years working in different projects, I realized that I should be providing my time and energy to companies doing something that really matters to me, instead of just trying to be the next unicorn and having pizza fridays. I realize that the world problems are not solved with tech, though - they are mostly socio-political - but I would like to help out as I can. I currently work as a frontend developer at Ecosia in Berlin.

I care a lot about libre software. I'm a fulltime Linux user and so far I don't see a reason to change that. I find it very unfortunate that Apple dominates most of the tech scene. I thought developers were supposed to be more informed and curious, but instead most have settled for closed software in walled garden environments. That's not to say I don't see the value in Apple's software ecosystem - I just don't think it's a valuable trade-off.

I'm also very interested in Internet Privacy. Yes, I belong to the 5% that stuck to using Firefox ü¶äüåç even in their dark times. But it's getting much better - arguably the best! I also believe we will finally see a post-google environment in the next years, where Google no longer has the lion's share of search, browser, and phone markets.

Finally, I care a lot about human and animal rights. I've been mostly vegetarian for almost ten years, and vegan for the past 5. I love browsing recipe blogs and subreddits and trying alternative ingredients that make people show the funniest facial expressions when they hear about them. Did you know you can use the water from a can of chickpeas as replacement for eggs in a merengue?
