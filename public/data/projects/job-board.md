  Job Board in development for ReDI School
status: Prototype
---

I've been leading the development of the community-driven Job Board frontend app from ReDI School of Integration. The project has not been released as of the writing of this. We have created a React app using Material UI to acelerate development. We've been managing the project using a Github project board. The goal is to create several tasks that are acessible to ReDI students who can join the effort in maintaining the board.
