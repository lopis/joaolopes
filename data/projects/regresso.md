Regresso is a clicker game where you have a series of actions and tasks. Gameplay is about 5-10 minutes if you don't screw up.

Your ship wrecked in an unknown land. Keep your crew well fed while you strugle your way through finding the resources to rebuild the caravel and get back to the sea. As the game progresses, you will find different actions are available to you. Try to reach the goal as fast as possible and with the least deaths for the best score. \n Coil users have a head-start of food, as well as a little help from god.

This game uses a mix of CSS animations and SVG animations for the main game display. The rest of the UI is basic DOM - CSS, HTML, JS. I have written [two](/how-to-design-a-javascript-game-13kb) [blog posts](/how-to-design-a-javascript-game-in-13kb-or-less) that go a bit more into dept regarding game design and SVG animations.
