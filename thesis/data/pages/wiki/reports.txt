=== First semester Report ===
This reports contains the details of the literary review and definition of the work plan. To summarize, this report proposes the development of a tool that converts a MABS created in Repast into MAS that uses JADE. Conversely, it should allow the conversion of a JADE MAS into a Repast MABS as well. This tool is useful in the context of development of a MAS whose development started as a MABS or when the need to create a simulation arises during development. JADE and Repast were chosen for this thesis not only for their quality but also for their widespread use.

After this introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 starts by discussing some related work about JADE, Repast and about integrating both frameworks. While the motivation for this thesis pertains the improvement of MAS development methodologies, its goal is to convert the code from one framework to the other. Therefore, a large part of this thesis will be about Java code transformations and part of the state-of-the-art review is related to code transformation tools.

Chapter 3 includes a detailed work plan for the following months and describes the details of the development environment as well as the definition of how the final product will be validated and evaluated. Finally, chapter 4 includes final notes about this report and about the work done so far.
