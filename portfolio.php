			<strong>FROW API</strong> is meant to be a library that powers avatar enabled 
			applications. If you ever developed a small game or web application, you might have
			considered allowing your users to create a custom avatar and Frown tries to
			make that task easier. We also created our own web app to showcase Frown's potencial.

			A <strong>FROWN API</strong> foi criada para ser uma biblioteca de auxilio a 
			aplicações com avatares. Se alguma vez desenvolveste um jogo ou aplicação web,
			poderás ter considerado a hipótese de permitir aos utilizadores criar um avatar
			personalizado e a Frown tenta facilitar essa tarefa. Também desenvolvemos
			uma web app para mostrar o potencial da bilioteca.

			<strong>TchiRSS</strong> is a web app I create to easily track changes to my RSS feeds without having to rely on other services. It sits on your local or remote PHP Apache server and you can set it as your homepage and, for instance, check when was the last time your manga series released a new chapter.
			Tchi is still under development.
